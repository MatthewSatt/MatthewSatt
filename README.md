### Hi there 👋

I am a passionate software engineer and I enjoy creating responsive and interacitve websites that use technologies like HTML, React, CSS3, JavaScript, and Python. Additionally, I enjoy following the path laid out by backend routes and finding the source of a bug.

- 👨🏻‍💻 I’m currently attending App Academy to sharpen my skills.
